    "\n",
    "- **Format**: Total return for each unit bet.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Fractional Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format**: Profit relative to stake, shown as a fraction.\n",
    "- **Example**: Odds of 3/1 (read as \"three-to-one\") mean for every $\\$1$ bet, profit is $\\$3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### American Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format**: Positive and negative numbers indicating profit on $\\$100$ bet or amount to bet for $\\$100$ profit.\n",
    "- **Example**: +150 means win $\\$150$ on a $\\$100$ bet; -150 means need to bet $\\$150$ to win $\\$100$.\n"
